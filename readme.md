Description:

A password generator that generates a random password based on the criteria of the password length and character types. The password length must be a number that's at least 8 characters, but no more than 128 characters in the input box, and at least one option under character types must be chosen (checkmark box) in order to overall generate a random password. Otherwise, an instruction will be shown in the password box. The website is also a responsive layout for mobile screens, which means that the elements are nicely fit in different screens sizes.
The password generator and the website is done through HTML, CSS, and Javascript code in Visual Studio Code, and utilizes Bootstrap with its components and utilities. The css file contains standard css practices and media queries, whereas in the javascript file, it contains variables (large amounts), objects, functions, for-loops, and if-else statements.

Technologies:

. HTML
. CSS
. Javascript
. Bootstrap
. Visual Studio Code

Challenges:

It was a challenging homework criteria was to use alerts/confirms/prompts as well as password length input. 

Initially,I didn't really know where to start and I was slightly overwhelmed with numerous thoughts, however ,I started my pseudo-code .I went through lecture videos and also looking through a couple of password generator examples online in order to understand javascript code.

I was able to solve each of my problems ultimately through persistent efforts and looking at online resources!
